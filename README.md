# Capstone Project - Hungarian Quotes App

## Stage 1

### Project Overview

In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages. In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the "Instructions" node.

### Why this Project?

To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app.

### What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

- An app description
- UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects
- A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

## Stage 2

### Project Overview

In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!

### Why this Project?

In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

### What Will I Learn?

The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app.
